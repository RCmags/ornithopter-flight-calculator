# Ornithopter flight calculator - v1.0
---

This program calculates various flight parameters for an ornithopter in level flight. The aircraft is modeled as a single set of wings that generate a certain amount of lift and thrust. We estimate the mechanical power required for flight and the electrical power drawn by an electric motor. The lift during gliding flight is also used to estimate the strength of a spring needed to keep the wings from collapsing.

The program outputs a table listing the inputs to the model, along with the values above and other useful parameters. It also generates plots for the lift distribution and twist of the wing during the upstroke, the downstroke, and glide. The wing planform is also shown, in addition to the geometry and torque generated by the spring. 

__NOTE__: this version uses a non-linear root solver to find the lift distributions of the wing. This form allows the airspeed to vary across the wingspan at the cost of a slow computation. 

### Requirements
The scripts were written in [Python 3.9.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and requires the following libraries: 
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/install/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html) 

### How to use
To execute the program, open the terminal/command prompt and browse to the folder containing the interface.py and run the command:  
```
>> python interface.py
```
If you are using windows, you can simply double click interface.py and to open it with [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html). 

To adjust the calculations, open interface.py with a text editor and change the input variables. These include wing twist as a function of the wingspan, air density, motor voltage, and many other parameters.
